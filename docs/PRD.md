## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Students studying for their GCSE Mathematics exams in the UK face significant challenges. They often receive limited individual attention in classrooms, making it difficult to address specific knowledge gaps or deep-seated misconceptions. This leads to a lack of confidence, exam anxiety, and a failure to achieve their full potential. Existing digital tools often function as simple question banks, failing to provide the sophisticated, adaptive, and pedagogically sound guidance needed to foster true understanding. Tutors are available, but at substantial expense and inflexible times.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

**Project Bloom** is an intelligent, adaptive AI tutor designed to provide every student with the benefits of one-on-one instruction. Built on a foundation of proven educational principles, the app will guide students toward genuine subject mastery. By diagnosing the root cause of errors and deploying targeted, evidence-based remedial strategies, Project Bloom will function not as a simple answer-checker, but as a sophisticated pedagogical partner.

## 2. Product Goals

* **For the Student:**
  * To build deep, durable conceptual understanding of the GCSE Maths curriculum.
  * To increase confidence and reduce anxiety associated with mathematics.
  * To provide an engaging and motivating learning experience that encourages consistent practice.
  * To empower students to achieve their target exam grades.
* **For the Parent:**
  * To offer a clear and actionable view of their child's progress, strengths, and areas needing improvement.
  * To provide peace of mind that their child is receiving high-quality, personalized academic support.
* **For the Business:**
  * To capture a significant share of the UK's secondary education support market.
  * To achieve high levels of user retention and daily engagement.
  * To establish the product as the gold standard for AI-driven, pedagogically-informed education.

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1 Primary Persona: The Ambitious Student

* **Name:** Aisha
* **Goal:** Wants to achieve a top grade (8 or 9) to study STEM subjects at A-Level. She is proactive and self-motivated but wants to ensure she has no hidden knowledge gaps and can solve the most challenging problems.
* **Frustration:** Finds that classroom teaching moves too slowly and generic revision guides don't challenge her enough. She wants an efficient way to identify and fix her specific weaknesses.

### 3.2 Secondary Persona: The Foundation Student

* **Name:** Ben
* **Goal:** Aims to secure a grade 4 or 5 to pass his maths requirement. He finds maths difficult, lacks confidence, and has gaps in his foundational knowledge from previous years.
* **Frustration:** Often feels lost in class and is embarrassed to ask questions. He needs a patient, non-judgmental environment where he can learn at his own pace and fix basic misunderstandings without feeling rushed.

### 3.3 Tertiary Persona: The Involved Parent

* **Name:** Sarah
* **Goal:** Wants to support her child's learning but doesn't feel confident in her own maths skills.
* **Frustration:** Finds it difficult to know how her child is truly progressing beyond school reports. She wants to understand where they are struggling and how she can help, without having to re-learn the entire curriculum herself.

## 4. Features & User Stories

### 4.1 Epic: Onboarding & Topic Selection

* **4.1.1 Account Creation:** As a new user (student or parent), I can create an account and link student/parent accounts together.
* **4.1.2 Syllabus Navigation:** As a student, I can see the full GCSE Maths syllabus, with a clear distinction between Higher and Foundation tier topics, so I can choose what to work on.
* **4.1.3 Topic Entry Choice:** As a student, when I select a topic, I am presented with a clear choice: **1. "Assess My Skills"** (to take a diagnostic quiz) or **2. "Browse Sub-skills"** (to select a specific lesson).

### 4.2 Epic: The Core Learning Loop

* **4.2.1 Mastery Bar:** As a student working on a sub-skill, I can see a visual "Mastery Bar" that fills from 0% to 100% to track my progress toward completion. Progression to new material is permitted only after a high proficiency criterion is met.
* **4.2.2 Practice Questions:** As a student, I can practice my skills by answering a stream of adaptive questions. (v0: Questions will be generated by an LLM; v1: Questions may be sourced from an educational partner).
* **4.2.3 Error Diagnosis:** As a student who makes a mistake, the app's diagnostic engine identifies the likely cognitive source of the error, differentiating between simple slips, procedural bugs, and deep misconceptions.
* **4.2.4 Adaptive Intervention:** As a student, the feedback I receive is tailored to my error type:
  * For **minor errors**, I am offered low-friction choices like "Try Again" or "Get a Hint.".
  * For **deep misconceptions**, the app signals the importance of the error and strongly recommends a targeted remedial micro-lesson, but gives me the final choice to engage with it or continue. This intervention is designed to challenge and restructure my underlying conceptual framework.
* **4.2.5 Remedial Strategies:** As a student engaging in a remedial lesson, the app uses a variety of proven pedagogical techniques, such as using visual models to explain algebraic concepts  or using cognitive conflict to challenge flawed beliefs [e.g., by testing a rule with a numerical counter-example].

### 4.3 Epic: Motivation & Engagement

* **4.3.1 Gamified Metrics:** As a student, I can earn points for correct answers and for mastering skills.
* **4.3.2 Practice Streaks:** As a student, I am encouraged to maintain a daily practice streak to build consistent study habits.
* **4.3.3 Achievements:** As a student, I can unlock and collect special badges for reaching milestones or mastering difficult topics (e.g., "Vector Virtuoso," "Probability Pro").
* **4.3.4 Leaderboards:** As a student, I can choose to see my point total on a leaderboard to compare my progress with other users.

### 4.4 Epic: Parent Portal

* **4.4.1 Progress Dashboard:** As a parent, I can log in to a simple dashboard to see my child's progress.
* **4.4.2 Key Insights:** The dashboard will provide at-a-glance information on skills mastered, time spent practicing, current practice streak, and persistent areas of difficulty, similar to reporting tools on established learning platforms.

## 5. Out of Scope (Version 1.0)

* **Teacher Functionality:** No teacher-specific dashboards, classroom management tools, or content assignment features.
* **Advanced AI Features:** Affective computing to detect student emotions (e.g., frustration) will not be included.
* **Live Support:** No integration with live human tutors.
* **Social Features:** No social features beyond the asynchronous leaderboards.
* **Curriculum:** Content will be limited to the GCSE Mathematics specification. A-Level or other subjects will not be included.
